This is a project I began to learn more about Facebook.  It is messy, incomplete and lacking all features.  However, it should be a good starting point for someone to learn how to build their own.
**Things this project can do:
  *Mobile Facebook webpage login
  *Navigate to specific Facebook page
  *Find a determined number of posts on a specific Facebook page
  *Scrape date of specific post
  *Scrape text of comments
  *Scrape text of comments of comments
**Things this project can*not* do
  *Scrape actual post text
  *Scrape dates of comments
  *Scrape comments beyond ~85 (There is a 'View More Comments' button that must be clicked)
